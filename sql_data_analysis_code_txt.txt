UPDATE house_data SET zip_code=(select distinct(zip_code) from house_data where city='Hudson County' and zip_code<>8037) where city='Hudson County' and zip_code=8037;
---select zip_code from house_data where city= 'Hudson County';
---so pincode got updated

select*from house_data;

---now we will check details about certain type of homes 
---also will be creating subqueries to make more classifications

--FIRST Query answers the issue of finding total number of Single Family houses in each city in New Jersey having atleast 1 bed and bath:
SELECT COUNT(id),city,bed FROM house_data 
WHERE home_type='Single Family' and bath>0 and bed>0
GROUP BY city,bed
ORDER BY bed desc;

--SECOND Query answers the issue of finding total number of Land houses in each city in New Jersey having atleast 1 bed and bath:
SELECT COUNT(id),city,bed FROM house_data 
WHERE home_type='Land' and bath>0 and bed>0
GROUP BY city,bed
ORDER BY bed desc;

--THIRD Query answers the issue of finding total number of MULTI Family houses in each city in New Jersey having atleast 1 bed and bath:
SELECT COUNT(id),city,bed FROM house_data 
WHERE home_type='Multi Family' and bath>0 and bed>0
GROUP BY city,bed
ORDER BY bed desc;

--The following queries answer the number of total houses with 3 different kind of homes:
select COUNT(*) from house_data WHERE home_type='Single Family';
---output: 169
select COUNT(*) from house_data WHERE home_type='Land';
---output: 162
select COUNT(*) from house_data WHERE home_type='Multi Family';
---output: 173

--one thing can be important i.e. for people thinking about opening business or creating office, they might choose the houses with no bed, atleast 1 bath and more than avg area:
select COUNT(id),home_type,city from house_data where bath>1 and bed=0 and house_size > (SELECT avg(house_size) from house_data)
GROUP BY city,home_type

--amenities check
---With everything:
select COUNT(id),home_type,city from house_data where bath>0 and bed>0 and play_ground='Y' and swimming_tank='Y'
GROUP BY city,home_type;
--total:92
---With everything except bath:
select COUNT(id),home_type,city from house_data where bath=0 and bed>0 and play_ground='Y' and swimming_tank='Y'
GROUP BY city,home_type;
--total:20
---With everything except bed:
select COUNT(id),home_type,city from house_data where bath>0 and bed=0 and play_ground='Y' and swimming_tank='Y'
GROUP BY city,home_type;
--total:13
---With everything except play ground:
select COUNT(id),home_type,city from house_data where bath>0 and bed>0 and play_ground='N' and swimming_tank='Y'
GROUP BY city,home_type;
--total:77
---With everything except swimming tank:
select COUNT(id),home_type,city from house_data where bath>0 and bed>0 and play_ground='Y' and swimming_tank='N'

--some analysis on date data
---highest actual sold value first
select*from date_data where status='Sold' ORDER BY actual_sold_price desc;
---newest actual sold value first
select*from date_data where status='Sold' ORDER BY sold_date desc;

--latest sale date and highest actual sold amount:
select sold_date from date_data where status='Sold' and sold_date =(SELECT sold_date from date_data ORDER BY sold_date desc LIMIT 1);
--output:"2021-03-05"
select actual_sold_price from date_data where status='Sold' order by actual_sold_price desc limit 1;
--output:499481

--total sold and pending figures
select count(*) from date_data where status='Sold';
